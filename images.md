## Flex Sensor Connections

The diagram below illustrates how to connect the flex sensors to the Arduino Uno:

1. **Flex Sensor**: The flex sensor is connected to the **Analog Input Pins (A0 to A3)** of the Arduino Uno to measure the bending of the sensor.
2. **10k Resistor**: A pull-down resistor of 10kΩ is used to stabilize the output voltage from the flex sensor.
3. **Wiring**:
   - One terminal of the flex sensor is connected to the **Analog Input Pin** of the Arduino.
   - The other terminal is connected to **5V (Power)**.
   - The 10kΩ resistor is placed between the flex sensor and **Ground (GND)**.

This setup allows the Arduino to read analog voltage variations caused by bending the flex sensor and translate them into usable data for gesture recognition.

### Note:
- Ensure proper connections to avoid short circuits.
- Verify that the Arduino's Analog pins (A0-A3) are correctly assigned in the code.
