Sensor Glove for Sign Language Translation
Overview
The Sensor Glove for Sign Language Translation is a wearable device designed to bridge communication gaps between deaf and hearing individuals. It converts sign language gestures into text or speech in real time using flex sensors, an Arduino microcontroller, Bluetooth communication, and a mobile app.

Features
•	Gesture Recognition: Detects hand movements and finger bends using flex sensors.
•	Real-Time Translation: Converts gestures into text or speech instantly.
•	Mobile Integration: Displays output via a Bluetooth-connected app.
•	Accessible Design: Lightweight and easy to use for everyday communication.

System Components
1.	Flex Sensors: Capture finger movements.
2.	Arduino Uno: Processes gesture data.
3.	Bluetooth Module (HC-05): Transmits data wirelessly to the mobile app.
4.	Mobile Application: Built using MIT App Inventor, it displays text and provides text-to-speech output.
<br>
Usage
1.	Wear the glove and pair it with the mobile app via Bluetooth.
2.	Perform sign language gestures; the glove processes them into recognizable data.
3.	View the translation as text or hear it as speech on the app.
